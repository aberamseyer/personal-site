# I open-sourced my Bible Research tool
I mentioned I would be trying to open sourcing my [Bible research tool](https://abe.ramseyer.dev/work/open-sourcing/) in my most recent blog post.
I didn't put quite as much effort into trying to get this project runnable, but if you are really determined, it should not be too difficult. It's simple php/apache/sqlite. It used to have mysql and redis, then I learned how to scale down for what I actually need.

In all honesty, I have loved learning to build for what is actually needed, which 99% of the time isn't planetscale.

As promised, [here it is](https://github.com/aberamseyer/rcv/tree/master). Hope you enjoy it! Many many hours of refinement have gone into it. Again, it's not pretty, but it's mine
